This project is a work in progress. There are lots of bugs and poor exception handling.

requires: (bash?), youtube-dl, requests, PySide2, mpv

Media Browser meant to be a minimal tool used for quickly playing and downloading videos without the tracking and privacy risks of a web browser. It uses requests for network requests and youtube-dl to play and download videos. At the moment it only plays videos with mpv through a subprocess, more players will be added and mpv will be removed as a requirement
